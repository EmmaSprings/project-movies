# Project Movies
Displaying the latest movies and their brief in separate pages through React Router.

## The problem
We built a foundation with React Router, then fetching the API data and displaying it and styling it using styled components. If we had more time we would add several pages and continue seeing over the possbilities of refactoring the code.
